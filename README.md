I made a project on #WebScraping and #Automation using #Selenium as a part of #pepcoding hackathon. I thought of utilizing the opportunity to make some project with real life utility. My Project #StockStart is basically stock knowledge for starters. It is aimed to benefit newbies into the field of stock market. As beginners have no clue about which stock to invest in ... so they are not able to search for a specific stock. #StockStart provides data of top 10 stocks in all the sectors (like IT, Banking etc.) and previous 6 months returns of these stocks. It then sorts the stocks on the basis of maximum returns in past 6 months and provides the data in a text file. After making a separate text file for each sector, It then calculates the "average" returns of top 10 stocks in each sector, then sorts on the basis of the sector in which the returns have been maximum, creating a FinalVerdict.txt file.
