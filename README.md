# Stock-Scraping-Project-StockStart- Today, I made a project on Web Scraping and Automation using Selenium - webdriver and javaScript as a part of #pepcoding hackathon. I thought of utilizing the opportunity to make some project with real time utility. My Project #StockStart is basically stock knowledge for starters. It is aimed to benefit those who are new into the field of stock market and have absolutely zero knowledge for the same. #StockStart provides a complete data set for top 10 stocks in all the sectors (like IT sector, Banking sector etc) and the previous 6 months returns of all the top 10 stocks in each sector. It then sorts the stocks on the basis of maximum returns in past 6 months and provides the data in a .txt file. It also calculates the average returns of top 10 stocks in each sector, then sorts on the basis of the sector in which the returns have been maximum, creating a FinalVerdict.txt file.
